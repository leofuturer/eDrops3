# Possible improvements/todos:

1. Add favicon.ico to website.
2. Currently, "Upload Mask File" on main page is disabled unless customer logs in. Would be better to always enable link and redirect to login page if not logged in. If user is admin or foundry worker...perhaps redirect to somewhere else?
3. "Seein action" mispelled on home page.
4. Typos in "about us" section on home page.
5. Typos in footer.
6. Unhandled error when you try to add an empty address in the account page.
7.
