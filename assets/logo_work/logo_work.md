Anyway, here you go. Attached you’ll find a zip archive with all that I’ve worked on. EDrop Logo Vector.ai is the vector created in Adobe Illustrator. EDrop Logo Edit.psd is an edit of the export from Adobe Illustrator. The side of the tail of the ‘e’ was sticking out of the side of the logo in Illustrator and I couldn’t come up with a better way to remove it so I did it in photoshop. The final version of the logo can be found at EDrop Logo Final.png. I also added a .png of the drop for reference.

I’ll be coming to the lab one last time tomorrow so feel free to ask me if you have questions then.

Also see Ryan Zhu's group meeting slides. 8/2/2018 contains the final version of the logo, with previous work described in presentations from 6/6/2018 to 8/2/2018.
